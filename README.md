## Installation

Make sure you have node 16 or more installed. Make sure you have `yarn` installed. To install yarn run `npm install -G yarn`

### Starting the app
Every time you change branch you must check for, and install potential new packages, you can do this by running `yarn`.

Then to start the app, use `yarn start`.

Do not use `npm run` or `npm install`, as this will introduce another package manager in the project and will lead to messy, unwanted conflicts.
